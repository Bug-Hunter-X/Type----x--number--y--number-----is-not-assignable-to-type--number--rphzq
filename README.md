This repository contains a TypeScript bug report and its solution. The bug demonstrates a type error where a function expecting an object of type '{ x: number; y: number }' is provided with a number, which results in a type error. The solution modifies the function to handle both object and number inputs, making the code more robust. The solution shows how to handle unexpected input types to prevent runtime errors.
